# Ash Phoenix Application Starter Kit

![Unit Tests](https://github.com/kamaroly/ash-phoenix-starter/actions/workflows/elixir.yaml/badge.svg)


A starter Kit that helps you build what's unique to your application faster. 

Don't reinvent the wheel for common features. Clone it, rename it and start shipping with confidence. 

Built for fast prototype and scaling in the future.

You can find concepts used in this kit in the [Ash Framework for Phoenix Developers](https://medium.com/@lambert.kamaro/ash-framework-for-phoenix-developpers-c29b0a147552) blog serie. I will continue to add features and documentation as time permits.
